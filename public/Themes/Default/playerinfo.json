/*
 * An example of how a new graphic overlay's settings will be stored.
 * It will require:
 * 		- an unique id which can be used to designate which overlay it is exactly.
 *		- an object which will hold all infomration asociated with that overlay.
 * 
 * This is the information for the player info overlay. Currently there are only
 * 4 options for this specific graphic overlay:
 * 		- visible : whether this is seen on the screen.
 * 		- animate : whether this overlay is animated when it is shown or hidden.
 * 		- display_text : all attributes of the text shown on the overlay.
 * 		- player_headshot : the attributes of the picture of the player to be
 *												shown, which will default to the team's primary logo.
