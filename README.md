# yagos (Yet Another Graphic Overlay System)

## Running the Program

From the command line (Windows cmd or linux shell), run `node yagos-server.js`.
This will start a webserver at `localhost:3000` where you can navigate to the
various controls. `localhost:3000/control-panel` controls graphics output for
example, while `localhost:3000/hockey-scoreboard` contains controls to modify
a hockey scoreboard.
